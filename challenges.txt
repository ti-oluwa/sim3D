Here I document the challenges I have faced so far in this project and how I tackled them.

1. Units and Units conversion
    - Challenge: Using SI units as the base units or using imperial (oi field) units. 

    - Solution: Since it a reservoir simulation software, I decided to stick with Field (Imperial units) as the base units.
    and then defined constants for conversion to and from SI units. This way it appeals and is more familiar to the oil and gas industry professionals or
    researchers who this is targeted at.

2. Defining injection and production rates on reservoir model grid:
    - Challenge: Injection and production rates are defined on a single grid cell. This means the initial rate is focused on a single cell which can lead to unphysical results like
    negative pressure in the reservoir, unrealistic saturation distribution (Sx > 1 or Sx < 0), Numerical instability. This cuased the simulation to even fail at the first time step
    due to the check for negative pressure failing.
