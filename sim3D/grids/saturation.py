    Build 3-phase (Sw, So, Sg) saturation grids from fluid contact depths.

    Supports capillary-pressure-like transitions where saturation gradients
    follow a power-law profile, producing more realistic blending than
    linear interpolation.

    **Physical Basis:**
    This implementation accounts for the fact that residual oil saturation depends
    on the displacing fluid:
    - Gas cap: Uses Sor_gas (residual oil when gas displaces oil)
    - Water zone: Uses Sor_water (residual oil when water displaces oil)
    - Oil zone: Contains mobile oil with connate water and residual gas

    **Zones (sharp):**
      - Above GOC → gas cap (gas + residual oil to gas + connate water)
      - Between GOC and OWC → oil zone (oil + connate water + residual gas)
      - Below OWC → water zone (water + residual oil to water + no gas)

    **Zones (with capillary transition):**
      - Gas-oil and oil-water interfaces vary smoothly based on
        `transition_curvature_exponent`.

      - Small exponents (< 1) → more abrupt change.
      - Larger exponents (> 1) → smoother, curved transition.

    sor_w = np.full_like(thickness, 0.30)   # 30% residual oil to water
    sor_g = np.full_like(thickness, 0.15)   # 15% residual oil to gas
    sgr = np.full_like(thickness, 0.05)     # 5% residual gas
    porosity = np.full_like(thickness, 0.22)

    Normalize saturations to ensure they sum to 1.0 in all active cells.

    This function ensures mass balance by forcing the saturation constraint:
        Sw + So + Sg = 1.0

    The normalization process:
    1. Computes total saturation: total = Sw + So + Sg
    2. Identifies valid cells: active cells with total > 0
    3. Normalizes each phase: S_phase = S_phase / total
    4. Zeros out saturations in inactive cells

    Inactive cells (porosity <= 0 or NaN) are set to zero saturation for all phases.

    :param oil_saturation: Oil saturation grid (fraction).
    :param gas_saturation: Gas saturation grid (fraction).
    :param active: Boolean mask indicating active cells.
    :return: Tuple of normalized (water_saturation, oil_saturation, gas_saturation) grids.
