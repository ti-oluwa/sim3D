        The oil recovery factor based on initial oil in place and cumulative oil produced

        Oil Recovery Factor (RF) = Cumulative Oil Produced / Stock Tank Oil Initially in Place

        This is the fundamental measure of reservoir performance, representing the fraction
        of original oil in place that has been recovered. The recovery factor depends on:

        Primary Recovery Mechanisms:
            - Solution Gas Drive: 5-30% RF (gas expansion as pressure drops)
            - Gas Cap Drive: 20-40% RF (gas cap expansion displaces oil)
            - Natural Water Drive: 35-75% RF (aquifer influx maintains pressure)
            - Gravity Drainage: 40-80% RF (oil drains to bottom under gravity)
            - Combination Drive: 25-50% RF (multiple mechanisms)

        Secondary Recovery (Pressure Maintenance):
            - Water Flooding: 30-60% RF (injected water displaces oil)
            - Gas Injection: 40-70% RF (gas maintains pressure, displaces oil)

        Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR):
            - Chemical Flooding: 50-70% RF (surfactants reduce interfacial tension)
            - Thermal Recovery: 50-80% RF (steam/combustion reduces viscosity)
            - CO2 Flooding: 40-60% RF (miscible displacement)

        Factors Affecting Recovery:
            - Reservoir properties: porosity, permeability, heterogeneity
            - Fluid properties: viscosity, density, API gravity
            - Drive mechanism: water drive > gas cap > solution gas
            - Well spacing and placement
            - Operating conditions: production rates, pressures
            - Sweep efficiency: areal, vertical, and displacement
            - Residual oil saturation

        Units:
            Numerator: Cumulative oil produced in STB (stock tank barrels)
            Denominator: Initial oil in place in STB (stock tank barrels)
            Result: Dimensionless fraction (0.0 to 1.0, or 0% to 100%)

        Calculation Details:
            STOIIP = Σ [Area x h x φ x (1-Swi) x NTG / Boi]
            Np = Σ [q_oil x Δt / Bo]
            RF = Np / STOIIP

        Where:
            Area = Grid cell area (acres)
            h = Net pay thickness (ft)
            φ = Porosity (fraction)
            Swi = Initial water saturation (fraction)
            NTG = Net-to-gross ratio (fraction)
            Boi = Initial oil formation volume factor (bbl/STB)
            q_oil = Oil production rate (STB/day)
            Δt = Time step (days)
            Bo = Oil formation volume factor (bbl/STB)

        :return: The oil recovery factor as a fraction (0 to 1)

        Example:
        ```python
        analyst = Analyst(states)
        rf = analyst.oil_recovery_factor
        print(f"Oil Recovery Factor: {rf:.2%}")
        # Oil Recovery Factor: 32.50%

        stoiip = analyst.stoiip
        cumulative = analyst.cumulative_oil_produced
        remaining = stoiip - cumulative
        print(f"Recovered: {cumulative:,.0f} STB ({rf:.1%})")
        print(f"Remaining: {remaining:,.0f} STB ({1-rf:.1%})")
        # Recovered: 1,250,000 STB (32.5%)
        # Remaining: 2,596,154 STB (67.5%)
        ```

        Notes:
            - Recovery factor increases monotonically over production life
            - Ultimate recovery factor (URF) is RF at economic abandonment
            - Low RF (<20%) suggests poor drive mechanism or early production stage
            - High RF (>50%) indicates good drive mechanism or enhanced recovery
            - For mature fields, RF typically plateaus unless EOR is applied
            - Compare RF to material balance drive indices to understand mechanism
            - Use sweep efficiency analysis to identify uncontacted oil

        """
        Automatically recommend the best decline curve model based on statistical fit and physical constraints.

        This method fits all three decline curve models (exponential, harmonic, and hyperbolic) to the
        historical production data and recommends the most appropriate model based on multiple criteria:

        1. Statistical Fit Quality (R² coefficient of determination)
        2. Physical Reasonableness of Parameters
        3. Standard Industry Guidelines

        Model Selection Criteria:

        Exponential Decline - Best For:
        - Wells in boundary-dominated flow (late-time production)
        - Wells with relatively constant pressure drawdown
        - Single-phase flow above bubble point
        - Conservative reserves estimates
        - Short production history where flow regime is uncertain

        Characteristics:
        - Constant percentage decline rate
        - Most conservative EUR estimates
        - Simple to extrapolate and understand
        - Commonly required for SEC reserves reporting

        Equation: q(t) = qi x exp(-Di x t)

        Harmonic Decline - Best For:
        - Wells with linear flow geometry (fractured wells, channel reservoirs)
        - Wells experiencing stable water influx
        - Gas wells in steady-state flow
        - Certain infinite-acting reservoirs

        Characteristics:
        - Decline rate decreases inversely with time
        - Can overestimate EUR if misapplied
        - Special case of hyperbolic with b = 1

        Equation: q(t) = qi / (1 + Di x t)

        Hyperbolic Decline - Best For:
        - Wells transitioning between flow regimes
        - Multi-phase flow systems
        - Wells with changing flowing conditions
        - Modern unconventional wells (shale, tight formations)
        - Wells with sufficient production history (>1-2 years)

        Characteristics:
        - Most flexible model with b-factor controlling curvature
        - 0 < b < 1: Most common for conventional oil wells
        - b ≈ 0.5: Typical for many hydraulically fractured wells
        - Requires more data for reliable parameter estimation

        Equation: q(t) = qi / (1 + b x Di x t)^(1/b)

        Parameter Validation Rules:

        Decline Rate (Di):
        - Valid range: 0.0 to 2.0 per year (0% to 200% annual decline)
        - Typical ranges:
          * Conventional oil wells: 5-25% per year (0.05-0.25)
          * Tight oil/shale: 30-80% first year (0.3-0.8)
          * Gas wells: 10-40% per year (0.1-0.4)
          * Mature fields: <10% per year (<0.1)
        - Models with Di outside valid range are rejected

        Hyperbolic Exponent (b):
        - Valid range: 0.0 to 2.0 (dimensionless)
        - Physical interpretation:
          * b = 0: Exponential decline
          * 0 < b < 0.3: Slightly curved, approaching exponential
          * 0.3 < b < 0.7: Moderate curvature, common for fractured wells
          * 0.7 < b < 1.0: Strong curvature, approaching harmonic
          * b = 1.0: Harmonic decline
          * b > 1.0: Very slow decline, often unrealistic for long-term forecast
        - SEC guidelines: b > 1.0 often requires justification
        - Models with b outside 0.0-2.0 range are rejected

        R² (Coefficient of Determination):
        - Measures goodness of fit: R² = 1 - (SS_residual / SS_total)
        - R² ranges from 0.0 to 1.0:
          * R² > 0.95: Excellent fit
          * 0.90 < R² < 0.95: Good fit
          * 0.80 < R² < 0.90: Acceptable fit
          * R² < 0.80: Poor fit, model may not be appropriate
        - Higher R² is preferred, but must also pass physical constraints

        Selection Algorithm:
        1. Fit all three models to historical data
        2. Eliminate models with physically unreasonable parameters
        3. Among remaining models, select the one with highest R²
        4. If all models fail validation, return "exponential" as conservative default

        Minimum Data Requirements:
        - Exponential: Minimum 6-12 months (2-4 data points)
        - Harmonic: Minimum 12-18 months (4-6 data points)
        - Hyperbolic: Minimum 18-24 months (6-8 data points) for reliable b-factor

        :param from_time_step: Starting time step index for analysis (inclusive).
            Should include stable production period, avoiding
            initial transient flow or well cleanup period.
        :param to_time_step: Ending time step index for analysis (inclusive).
            Use -1 for most recent time step. More data generally
            improves fit quality, but ensure data represents similar
            operating conditions.
        :param phase: Phase to analyze - "oil", "gas", or "water".
            Different phases may have different optimal decline models.
            Gas typically has steeper decline than oil.

        best_model = all_models[recommended]
        forecast = analyst.forecast_production(best_model, time_steps=365*10)
        ```

        Notes:
            - Always review all three model fits visually before accepting recommendation
            - High R² does not guarantee accurate long-term forecasts
            - Consider using multiple models for P10/P50/P90 reserve scenarios:
              * P90 (conservative): Exponential or steepest decline
              * P50 (best estimate): Recommended model
              * P10 (optimistic): Harmonic or shallowest decline
            - For regulatory reporting (SEC), exponential is often required regardless of fit
            - Hyperbolic decline should transition to exponential for long-term forecasts
              (typically after 3-5 years or when bxDixt > 0.5)
            - Be cautious with harmonic decline (b=1.0) as it may overestimate reserves
            - If well has undergone stimulation, workover, or facility changes during
              history period, consider analyzing pre- and post-change periods separately
            - Water production typically follows different decline patterns than oil/gas
            - For unconventional wells, hyperbolic is usually most appropriate for
              first 2-5 years, then transition to exponential

        Industry Best Practices:
            - SPE: Use hyperbolic to exponential transition for proved reserves
            - SEC: Often requires exponential for proved undeveloped reserves
            - Operators: Use model that best matches analog well performance
            - Always perform sensitivity analysis on decline parameters
            - Update decline curves annually as new production data becomes available

        Forecast future production rates based on fitted decline curve parameters.

        This method extrapolates production rates into the future using the decline curve
        model and parameters obtained from historical data analysis. The forecast continues
        until either the specified number of time steps is reached or the production rate
        falls below the economic limit.

        Forecast Equations by Decline Type:

        1. Exponential Decline:
        q(t) = qi x exp(-Di x t)

        Where:
        - q(t) = production rate at time t
        - qi = initial production rate at start of forecast
        - Di = nominal decline rate (fraction per year)
        - t = time since start of forecast (years)

        2. Harmonic Decline:
        q(t) = qi / (1 + Di x t)

        Where:
        - q(t) = production rate at time t
        - qi = initial production rate
        - Di = initial decline rate (fraction per year)
        - t = time (years)

        3. Hyperbolic Decline:
        q(t) = qi / (1 + b x Di x t)^(1/b)

        Where:
        - q(t) = production rate at time t
        - qi = initial production rate
        - Di = initial decline rate (fraction per year)
        - b = hyperbolic exponent (0 < b ≤ 2)
        - t = time (years)

        Special cases:
        - b = 0: Exponential decline
        - b = 1: Harmonic decline
        - 0 < b < 1: Most common for oil wells

        Economic Limit:
        The economic limit is the minimum production rate at which continued operation
        is economically viable. When the forecasted rate falls below this threshold,
        the well is considered to have reached its economic life and forecasting stops.

        Time Conversion:
        The method automatically handles time unit conversion based on the
        time_step_size_unit used in the original decline_curve_analysis. The decline
        rates are converted from annual basis to the appropriate time step basis.

        :param decline_result: `DeclineCurveResult` object containing fitted decline parameters
            from `decline_curve_analysis()` method. Must have valid parameters
            (no error flag set).
        :param time_steps: Number of time steps to forecast into the future.
            Time steps use the same unit as the original analysis.
        :param economic_limit: Optional minimum economic production rate. Forecasting stops
            when predicted rate falls below this value. Units must match
            the phase being analyzed (STB/day for oil/water, scf/day for gas).
            Default is None (no economic limit applied).
        :return: List of tuples containing (time_step, forecasted_rate). Time steps are
            absolute values continuing from the last historical time step. Returns
            empty list if decline_result contains errors.

        Example:
        ```python
        # Perform decline curve analysis
        result = analyst.decline_curve_analysis(
            from_time_step=0,

            - Forecasts assume no changes in well operations or reservoir conditions
            - For hyperbolic decline with b > 1, rates may decline too slowly at late time;

        Calculate Estimated Ultimate Recovery (EUR) using decline curve analysis.

        EUR represents the total cumulative production expected from a well or reservoir
        over its economic life. This method uses analytical integration of decline curve
        equations to calculate cumulative production rather than numerical summation,
        providing accurate results efficiently.

        Cumulative Production Equations by Decline Type:

        1. Exponential Decline:
        Np = (qi - qf) / Di

        Where:
        - Np = cumulative production from qi to qf
        - qi = initial production rate (STB/day or scf/day)
        - qf = final production rate at abandonment (STB/day or scf/day)
        - Di = nominal decline rate (1/year)

        Derivation: Integrate q = qi x exp(-Dixt) from t=0 to t=abandonment time

        2. Harmonic Decline:
        Np = (qi / Di) x ln(1 + Di x t)

        Where:
        - Np = cumulative production over time t
        - qi = initial production rate
        - Di = initial decline rate (1/year)
        - t = time period (years)
        - ln = natural logarithm

        Alternatively: Np = (qi / Di) x ln(qi / qf)

        Derivation: Integrate q = qi / (1 + Dixt) from t=0 to t=forecast_years

        3. Hyperbolic Decline:
        For b ≠ 1:
        Np = (qi^b / (Di x (1-b))) x [qi^(1-b) - qf^(1-b)]

        For b = 1 (harmonic case):
        Np = (qi / Di) x ln(qi / qf)

        Where:
        - Np = cumulative production
        - qi = initial production rate
        - qf = final production rate
        - Di = initial decline rate (1/year)
        - b = hyperbolic exponent (0 < b ≤ 2)

        Derivation: Integrate q = qi / (1 + bxDixt)^(1/b) from t=0 to abandonment time

        Physical interpretation of b:
        - b = 0: Exponential decline (boundary-dominated flow, constant %decline)
        - 0 < b < 1: Typical for oil wells (transitioning flow regimes)
        - b = 1: Harmonic decline (steady-state linear flow)
        - b > 1: Rare, may indicate water breakthrough or operational changes

        Economic Limit Consideration:
        The economic limit (qf) is the minimum rate at which operating costs equal revenue.
        Production is assumed to cease when the decline curve reaches this rate. The time
        to reach economic limit can be calculated:

        Exponential: t_econ = -ln(qf/qi) / Di
        Harmonic: t_econ = (qi - qf) / (Di x qf)
        Hyperbolic: t_econ = [(qi/qf)^b - 1] / (b x Di)

        The EUR calculation automatically limits the forecast time to either the specified
        forecast_years or the time to reach economic limit, whichever is shorter.

        Reserves Classification:
        - Proven Reserves: EUR based on well-calibrated decline curves with high confidence
        - Probable Reserves: EUR with moderate uncertainty, may use type curves
        - Possible Reserves: EUR with higher uncertainty, speculative parameters

        :param decline_result: `DeclineCurveResult` object from `decline_curve_analysis()` containing
            the fitted decline parameters (qi, Di, b) and decline type.
        :param forecast_years: Time horizon for EUR calculation in years. For exponential decline,
            this is often set to time when rate reaches economic limit. For
            harmonic/hyperbolic, may extend to facility life (20-40 years).
            Default is 30 years.
        :param economic_limit: Minimum economic production rate in same units as production
            (STB/day for oil/water, scf/day for gas). Production below this
            rate is assumed to be uneconomic. Default is 0.0 (no limit).
            Typical values: 5-20 STB/day for oil wells, 50-500 Mscf/day for gas.
        :param time_step_size_days: Size of one time step in days, used for time unit conversion.
            Should match the time step size used in the simulation.
            Default is 1.0 day per time step.
        :return: Estimated Ultimate Recovery (EUR) in stock tank barrels (STB) for oil/water
            or standard cubic feet (scf) for gas. Returns 0.0 if decline_result contains
            errors or if parameters are invalid.

        Example:
        ```python
        # Fit decline curve to historical data
        decline = analyst.decline_curve_analysis(
            from_time_step=0,
            to_time_step=365,
            decline_type="hyperbolic",
            phase="oil"
        )

        # Calculate EUR with 30-year forecast and 10 STB/day economic limit
        eur_stb = analyst.estimate_economic_ultimate_recovery(
            decline_result=decline,
            forecast_years=30.0,
            economic_limit=10.0
        )

        cumulative_to_date = analyst.cumulative_oil_produced
        remaining_reserves = eur_stb - cumulative_to_date
        recovery_factor = eur_stb / analyst.stoiip
        ```

        Notes:
            - EUR is highly sensitive to economic limit assumption; conduct sensitivity analysis
            - Exponential decline typically gives most conservative (lowest) EUR estimates
            - Harmonic decline can overestimate EUR if applied too early in well life
            - Hyperbolic decline with b > 0.5 may need transition to exponential at late time
            - Consider using P10/P50/P90 scenarios with different decline parameters
            - EUR does not account for:
            * Future workovers or recompletions
            * Changes in operating conditions
            * Facility constraints or downtime
            * Regulatory or market shutdowns
            - For gas wells, convert EUR from scf to reserves reporting units (Bcf, MMscf)
            - Always compare EUR to STOIIP/GIIP to ensure recovery factor is reasonable
