# Full API Reference

## Overview

This page lists every class, function, constant, and type exported from the `bores` package. Everything listed here is importable directly from `bores` (for example, `from bores import Config` or `import bores; bores.Config`). The API is organized by functional area to help you find what you need quickly.

The `bores` package uses wildcard re-exports from its internal modules. This means you never need to import from internal paths like `bores.wells.controls` or `bores.solvers.base`. Everything public is available at the top level. The only exception is the array PVT correlations, which must be imported from `bores.correlations.arrays` explicitly, and the visualization submodules (`bores.visualization.plotly1d`, `bores.visualization.plotly2d`, `bores.visualization.plotly3d`) which you can import by name for direct renderer access.

For detailed documentation of individual items, see the relevant sections in the [User Guide](../user-guide/index.md) and [Tutorials](../tutorials/index.md). For PVT correlation functions specifically, see the [Scalar Correlations](correlations-scalar.md) and [Array Correlations](correlations-array.md) pages.

## Utility Functions

Low-level array utility functions. These are primarily used internally but are available if you need them for custom computations.

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apply_mask()` | function | Apply a boolean mask to an array, setting masked cells to a fill value. |
| `clip()` | function | Clip array values to a range (like `np.clip` but numba friendly). |
| `clip_scalar()` | function | Clip a scalar value to a range. |
| `get_mask()` | function | Get a boolean mask from a condition applied to an array. |
| `is_array()` | function | Check if a value is a NumPy array. |
| `max_()` | function | Returns maximum of a scalar/array (like `np.max` but numba friendly). |
| `min_()` | function | Returns mininmum of a scalar/array (like `np.min` but numba friendly). |

## PVT Correlations

Scalar and array PVT correlation functions are documented separately due to their size:

- **[Scalar Correlations](correlations-scalar.md)**: 60+ single-value functions for point PVT calculations. Use these for quick checks, building custom tables, or validating against lab data.
- **[Array Correlations](correlations-array.md)**: Vectorized equivalents that operate on entire grids in a single call. The simulator uses these internally, and you can use them for post-processing or custom property computations.

Both modules share the same function names and parameters. The only difference is that scalar functions accept `float` inputs and array functions accept `NDimensionalGrid` inputs.
