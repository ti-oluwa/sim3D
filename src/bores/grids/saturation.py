    Build three-phase saturation grids from fluid contact depths and reservoir properties.

    Creates physically realistic water, oil, and gas saturation distributions based on:
    - Fluid contact depths (gas-oil contact, oil-water contact)
    - Residual saturations appropriate to each zone
    - Optional capillary transition zones for smooth saturation gradients

    This function properly accounts for the fact that residual oil saturation depends
    on the displacing fluid:
    - **Gas cap zone**: Uses Sor_gas (typically 0.10-0.25) - gas displaces oil efficiently
    - **Water zone**: Uses Sor_water (typically 0.20-0.35) - water leaves more residual oil
    - **Oil zone**: Contains mobile oil with connate water and residual gas

    ### Transition Zone Physics

    The optional transition zones mimic capillary pressure effects without explicit
    capillary pressure calculations. Saturation blending uses a power-law profile:

    ```LaTex
    $$w(z) = \left(\frac{z - z_{top}}{h_{transition}}\right)^{n}$$
    ```

    Where:
    - $w$ = blending weight (0 at top, 1 at bottom)
    - $z$ = depth within transition zone
    - $h_{transition}$ = transition zone thickness
    - $n$ = curvature exponent (controls profile shape)

    **Curvature exponent effects:**
    - n < 1: Sharper transition (approaching sharp contact)
    - n = 1: Linear interpolation
    - n = 2: Smooth, S-curved transition (recommended, realistic)
    - n > 3: Very gradual transition (may be unrealistic)

    ### Typical Parameter Values

    **Water-wet sandstone reservoir:**
    - Swc = 0.20-0.30 (connate water saturation)
    - Sor_water = 0.25-0.35 (residual oil to water displacement)
    - Sor_gas = 0.10-0.20 (residual oil to gas displacement)
    - Sgr = 0.03-0.08 (residual gas saturation)
    - GOC-OWC separation = 50-500 ft (typical oil column)
    - Transition thickness = 5-20 ft (if used)

    **Oil-wet carbonate reservoir:**
    - Swc = 0.15-0.25 (lower connate water)
    - Sor_water = 0.35-0.45 (higher residual oil)
    - Sor_gas = 0.15-0.30 (higher residual oil to gas)
    - Sgr = 0.05-0.10 (residual gas)

    :param depth_grid: Grid of cell-center depths (ft). Depth increases downward,
        where k=0 is the shallowest (top) layer and k=-1 is the deepest (bottom) layer.
        Shape: (nx, ny, nz).
    :param gas_oil_contact: Gas-oil contact depth (ft). Cells at depths less than this
        value are in the gas cap. Must be less than oil_water_contact.
    :param oil_water_contact: Oil-water contact depth (ft). Cells at depths greater than
        or equal to this value are in the water zone. Must be greater than gas_oil_contact.
    :param connate_water_saturation_grid: Connate (irreducible) water saturation for each
        cell (fraction, 0-1). This is the minimum water saturation that remains in the
        pore space even in the presence of hydrocarbons. Typical: 0.15-0.30.
        Shape: (nx, ny, nz).
    :param residual_oil_saturation_water_grid: Residual oil saturation when oil is
        displaced by water (fraction, 0-1). This is the oil that remains trapped after
        water imbibition. Higher in oil-wet systems. Typical: 0.20-0.35 (water-wet),
        0.35-0.45 (oil-wet). Shape: (nx, ny, nz).
    :param residual_oil_saturation_gas_grid: Residual oil saturation when oil is
        displaced by gas (fraction, 0-1). This is the oil that remains trapped after
        gas drainage. Typically lower than Sor_water due to favorable mobility ratio
        and wettability. Typical: 0.10-0.25. Shape: (nx, ny, nz).
    :param residual_gas_saturation_grid: Residual (trapped) gas saturation in the oil
        zone (fraction, 0-1). This is solution gas that has come out of solution but
        cannot flow. Typical: 0.03-0.08. Shape: (nx, ny, nz).
    :param porosity_grid: Porosity for each cell (fraction, 0-1). Used to identify
        active cells: cells with porosity <= 0 or NaN are considered inactive and
        set to zero saturation for all phases. Shape: (nx, ny, nz).
    :param use_transition_zones: If True, create smooth capillary-like transitions at
        fluid contacts. If False, use sharp (discontinuous) contacts. Default: False.
    :param gas_oil_transition_thickness: Thickness of the gas-oil transition zone (ft).
        The transition is centered on the GOC and extends ±thickness/2 around it.
        Only used if use_transition_zones=True. Typical: 5-20 ft. Default: 5.0.
    :param oil_water_transition_thickness: Thickness of the oil-water transition zone (ft).
        The transition is centered on the OWC and extends ±thickness/2 around it.
        Only used if use_transition_zones=True. Typical: 5-20 ft. Default: 5.0.
    :param transition_curvature_exponent: Power-law exponent controlling the shape of
        saturation gradients in transition zones (dimensionless). Higher values produce
        smoother, more realistic S-curves. Typical: 1.5-3.0. Default: 2.0.
        Only used if use_transition_zones=True.

    :return: Tuple of (water_saturation, oil_saturation, gas_saturation) grids, each
        with shape (nx, ny, nz). All three saturations sum to exactly 1.0 in active cells
        (where porosity > 0) and are 0.0 in inactive cells.

    :raises ValidationError: If inputs are invalid:
        - GOC >= OWC (contacts in wrong order)
        - Array shapes don't match
        - Saturation values outside [0, 1]
        - Physically impossible combinations (e.g., Swc + Sor > 1.0)
        - Transition zones overlap
        - Transition parameters are non-positive

    :warns UserWarning: If potentially problematic but not invalid:

    )
    ```

    Notes:
        - Depth increases downward: smaller depth = shallower (top), larger depth = deeper (bottom)
        - Gas cap: depth < GOC (shallowest zone, uses Sor_gas)
        - Oil zone: GOC ≤ depth < OWC (middle zone, uses Sgr)
        - Water zone: depth ≥ OWC (deepest zone, uses Sor_water)
        - Inactive cells (porosity ≤ 0 or NaN) have zero saturation for all phases
        - All saturations are normalized to sum to exactly 1.0 in active cells
        - For heterogeneous reservoirs, provide spatially varying property grids
        - Transition zones should not overlap: ensure (OWC - OWC) > (h_go + h_ow)/2

        - Oil saturation increases from Sor_gas to (1 - Swc - Sgr)

    Seed the (injected) phase saturation at injector cells to break the cold-start
    deadlock that occurs when the (injected) phase has zero relative permeability
    at initial conditions.

    In black-oil simulation the well productivity index is proportional to
    the (injected) phase mobility. When the (injected) phase saturation is zero at
    t=0, kr=0 exactly, PI=0, and the injector contributes nothing to the pressure
    equation regardless of BHP. No flux enters the cell, saturation stays zero,
    and the deadlock persists indefinitely. Setting a small nonzero saturation
    just above the kr=0 plateau at the injector perforations breaks this cycle
    on the first timestep.

    Oil saturation is reduced by the seed delta at every affected cell to preserve
    the saturation constraint Sw + So + Sg = 1. Oil is always chosen as the
    displaced phase because gas injection displaces oil (not connate water) and
    water injection displaces oil (not residual gas).

    When `relperm_table` is provided the seed is auto-detected by evaluating
    kr at a representative initial saturation state and scanning for the minimum
    (injected) phase saturation that yields kr > 0, stepped one table entry further
    into the nonzero region for numerical margin. When `seed_saturation` is
    provided it is used directly and `relperm_table` is ignored. At least one
    of the two must be supplied.

    :param oil_saturation_grid: Oil saturation grid (fraction, 0-1). Reduced by
        the seed delta at each injector cell to preserve the saturation constraint.
        Shape: (nx, ny, nz).

        when `phase == FluidPhase.WATER`. Shape: (nx, ny, nz).

        first saturation entry with kr > 0 is selected, stepped one entry further
