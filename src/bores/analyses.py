        Oil Recovery Factor (RF) = Cumulative Oil Produced / Stock Tank Oil Initially in Place

        This is the fundamental measure of reservoir performance, representing the fraction
        of original oil in place that has been recovered. The recovery factor depends on:

        Primary Recovery Mechanisms:
            - Solution Gas Drive: 5-30% RF (gas expansion as pressure drops)
            - Gas Cap Drive: 20-40% RF (gas cap expansion displaces oil)
            - Natural Water Drive: 35-75% RF (aquifer influx maintains pressure)
            - Gravity Drainage: 40-80% RF (oil drains to bottom under gravity)
            - Combination Drive: 25-50% RF (multiple mechanisms)

        Secondary Recovery (Pressure Maintenance):
            - Water Flooding: 30-60% RF (injected water displaces oil)
            - Gas Injection: 40-70% RF (gas maintains pressure, displaces oil)

        Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR):
            - Chemical Flooding: 50-70% RF (surfactants reduce interfacial tension)
            - Thermal Recovery: 50-80% RF (steam/combustion reduces viscosity)
            - CO2 Flooding: 40-60% RF (miscible displacement)

        Factors Affecting Recovery:
            - Reservoir properties: porosity, permeability, heterogeneity
            - Fluid properties: viscosity, density, API gravity
            - Drive mechanism: water drive > gas cap > solution gas
            - Well spacing and placement
            - Operating conditions: production rates, pressures
            - Sweep efficiency: areal, vertical, and displacement
            - Residual oil saturation

        Units:
            Numerator: Cumulative oil produced in STB (stock tank barrels)
            Denominator: Initial oil in place in STB (stock tank barrels)
            Result: Dimensionless fraction (0.0 to 1.0, or 0% to 100%)

        Calculation Details:
            STOIIP = Σ [Area x h x φ x (1-Swi) x NTG / Boi]
            Np = Σ [q_oil x Δt / Bo]
            RF = Np / STOIIP

        Where:
            Area = Grid cell area (acres)
            h = Net pay thickness (ft)
            φ = Porosity (fraction)
            Swi = Initial water saturation (fraction)
            NTG = Net-to-gross ratio (fraction)
            Boi = Initial oil formation volume factor (bbl/STB)
            q_oil = Oil production rate (STB/day)
            Δt = Time step (days)
            Bo = Oil formation volume factor (bbl/STB)

        :return: The oil recovery factor as a fraction (0 to 1)

        Example:
        ```python
        analyst = Analyst(states)
        rf = analyst.oil_recovery_factor
        print(f"Oil Recovery Factor: {rf:.2%}")
        # Oil Recovery Factor: 32.50%

        stoiip = analyst.stoiip
        cumulative = analyst.cumulative_oil_produced
        remaining = stoiip - cumulative
        print(f"Recovered: {cumulative:,.0f} STB ({rf:.1%})")
        print(f"Remaining: {remaining:,.0f} STB ({1-rf:.1%})")
        # Recovered: 1,250,000 STB (32.5%)
        # Remaining: 2,596,154 STB (67.5%)
        ```

        Notes:
            - Recovery factor increases monotonically over production life
            - Ultimate recovery factor (URF) is RF at economic abandonment
            - Low RF (<20%) suggests poor drive mechanism or early production stage
            - High RF (>50%) indicates good drive mechanism or enhanced recovery
            - For mature fields, RF typically plateaus unless EOR is applied
            - Compare RF to material balance drive indices to understand mechanism
            - Use sweep efficiency analysis to identify uncontacted oil

        Automatically recommend the best decline curve model based on statistical fit and physical constraints.

        This method fits all three decline curve models (exponential, harmonic, and hyperbolic) to the
        historical production data and recommends the most appropriate model based on multiple criteria:

        1. Statistical Fit Quality (R² coefficient of determination)
        2. Physical Reasonableness of Parameters
        3. Standard Industry Guidelines

        Model Selection Criteria:

        Exponential Decline - Best For:
        - Wells in boundary-dominated flow (late-time production)
        - Wells with relatively constant pressure drawdown
        - Single-phase flow above bubble point
        - Conservative reserves estimates
        - Short production history where flow regime is uncertain

        Characteristics:
        - Constant percentage decline rate
        - Most conservative EUR estimates
        - Simple to extrapolate and understand
        - Commonly required for SEC reserves reporting

        Equation: q(t) = qi x exp(-Di x t)

        Harmonic Decline - Best For:
        - Wells with linear flow geometry (fractured wells, channel reservoirs)
        - Wells experiencing stable water influx
        - Gas wells in steady-state flow
        - Certain infinite-acting reservoirs

        Characteristics:
        - Decline rate decreases inversely with time
        - Can overestimate EUR if misapplied
        - Special case of hyperbolic with b = 1

        Equation: q(t) = qi / (1 + Di x t)

        Hyperbolic Decline - Best For:
        - Wells transitioning between flow regimes
        - Multi-phase flow systems
        - Wells with changing flowing conditions
        - Modern unconventional wells (shale, tight formations)
        - Wells with sufficient production history (>1-2 years)

        Characteristics:
        - Most flexible model with b-factor controlling curvature
        - 0 < b < 1: Most common for conventional oil wells
        - b ≈ 0.5: Typical for many hydraulically fractured wells
        - Requires more data for reliable parameter estimation

        Equation: q(t) = qi / (1 + b x Di x t)^(1/b)

        Parameter Validation Rules:

        Decline Rate (Di):
        - Valid range: 0.0 to 2.0 per year (0% to 200% annual decline)
        - Typical ranges:
          * Conventional oil wells: 5-25% per year (0.05-0.25)
          * Tight oil/shale: 30-80% first year (0.3-0.8)
          * Gas wells: 10-40% per year (0.1-0.4)
          * Mature fields: <10% per year (<0.1)
        - Models with Di outside valid range are rejected

        Hyperbolic Exponent (b):
        - Valid range: 0.0 to 2.0 (dimensionless)
        - Physical interpretation:
          * b = 0: Exponential decline
          * 0 < b < 0.3: Slightly curved, approaching exponential
          * 0.3 < b < 0.7: Moderate curvature, common for fractured wells
          * 0.7 < b < 1.0: Strong curvature, approaching harmonic
          * b = 1.0: Harmonic decline
          * b > 1.0: Very slow decline, often unrealistic for long-term forecast
        - SEC guidelines: b > 1.0 often requires justification
        - Models with b outside 0.0-2.0 range are rejected

        R² (Coefficient of Determination):
        - Measures goodness of fit: R² = 1 - (SS_residual / SS_total)
        - R² ranges from 0.0 to 1.0:
          * R² > 0.95: Excellent fit
          * 0.90 < R² < 0.95: Good fit
          * 0.80 < R² < 0.90: Acceptable fit
          * R² < 0.80: Poor fit, model may not be appropriate
        - Higher R² is preferred, but must also pass physical constraints

        Selection Algorithm:
        1. Fit all three models to historical data
        2. Eliminate models with physically unreasonable parameters
        3. Among remaining models, select the one with highest R²
        4. If all models fail validation, return "exponential" as conservative default

        Minimum Data Requirements:
        - Exponential: Minimum 6-12 months (2-4 data points)
        - Harmonic: Minimum 12-18 months (4-6 data points)
        - Hyperbolic: Minimum 18-24 months (6-8 data points) for reliable b-factor

        :param from_step: Starting time step index for analysis (inclusive).
            Should include stable production period, avoiding
            initial transient flow or well cleanup period.
        :param to_step: Ending time step index for analysis (inclusive).
            Use -1 for most recent time step. More data generally
            improves fit quality, but ensure data represents similar
            operating conditions.
        :param phase: Phase to analyze - "oil", "gas", or "water".
            Different phases may have different optimal decline models.
            Gas typically has steeper decline than oil.
        :return: Tuple containing:
            1. str: Recommended model name ("exponential", "harmonic", or "hyperbolic")
            2. dict: Dictionary with all three model results for comparison
                Keys: "exponential", "harmonic", "hyperbolic"
                Values: DeclineCurveResult objects with parameters and fit statistics

        Example:
        ```python
        # Get recommendation and all model results
        recommended, all_models = analyst.recommend_decline_model(
            from_step=0,
            to_step=-1,
            phase="oil"
        )
        print(f"Recommended model: {recommended}")
        print(f"R² = {all_models[recommended].r_squared:.4f}")
        print(f"Di = {all_models[recommended].decline_rate_per_timestep:.3f} per year")
        if recommended == "hyperbolic":
            print(f"b = {all_models[recommended].b_factor:.3f}")

        # Compare EUR estimates from all models
        for model_name, result in all_models.items():
            if not result.error:
                eur = analyst.estimate_economic_ultimate_recovery(result, forecast_steps=30)
                print(f"{model_name}: EUR = {eur:,.0f} STB")

        # Use recommended model for forecasting
        best_model = all_models[recommended]
        forecast = analyst.forecast_production(best_model, steps=365*10)
        ```

        Notes:
            - Always review all three model fits visually before accepting recommendation
            - High R² does not guarantee accurate long-term forecasts
            - Consider using multiple models for P10/P50/P90 reserve scenarios:
              * P90 (conservative): Exponential or steepest decline
              * P50 (best estimate): Recommended model
              * P10 (optimistic): Harmonic or shallowest decline
            - For regulatory reporting (SEC), exponential is often required regardless of fit
            - Hyperbolic decline should transition to exponential for long-term forecasts
              (typically after 3-5 years or when bxDixt > 0.5)
            - Be cautious with harmonic decline (b=1.0) as it may overestimate reserves
            - If well has undergone stimulation, workover, or facility changes during
              history period, consider analyzing pre- and post-change periods separately
            - Water production typically follows different decline patterns than oil/gas
            - For unconventional wells, hyperbolic is usually most appropriate for
              first 2-5 years, then transition to exponential

        Industry Best Practices:
            - SPE: Use hyperbolic to exponential transition for proved reserves
            - SEC: Often requires exponential for proved undeveloped reserves
            - Operators: Use model that best matches analog well performance
            - Always perform sensitivity analysis on decline parameters
            - Update decline curves annually as new production data becomes available
