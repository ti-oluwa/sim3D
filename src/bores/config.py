    - Simulating high-rate wells with large near-wellbore pressure gradients
    - Reservoir pressure is low (<1000 psi) to maintain relative accuracy
    - Using highly compressible fluids (gas reservoirs)
    - Fine-grid simulations (<10m cells) where local variations are significant
    - Observing pressure oscillations or convergence issues

    **Relax to 150-300 psi when:**
    - Depletion studies with slow, uniform pressure decline
    - Field-scale models (>100m cells) where averaging reduces local variations
    - Reservoir pressure is high (>5000 psi) making relative changes small
    - Simulation is stable and material balance errors are acceptable
    - Computational efficiency is critical and accuracy requirements are relaxed

    **Guidelines by reservoir pressure:**
    - Low pressure (<1000 psi): 25-50 psi (2.5-5% relative change)
    - Moderate pressure (1000-3000 psi): 50-100 psi (2-5% relative change)
    - High pressure (3000-6000 psi): 100-200 psi (2-4% relative change)
    - Very high pressure (>6000 psi): 150-300 psi (2-5% relative change)

    Optional thread pool for concurrent matrix assembly during simulation.

    When provided, the three independent assembly stages in the pressure solver
    (accumulation, face transmissibilities, well contributions) and the two
    independent stages in the saturation solver (flux contributions, well rate
    grids) are submitted concurrently rather than run sequentially. The calling
    thread blocks only until all submitted stages complete, so the effective
    assembly time approaches the duration of the slowest stage rather than
    their sum.

    When None (default), all assembly stages run sequentially on the calling
    thread with zero threading overhead. This is the correct choice for small
    grids where threading bookkeeping exceeds the parallelism gain.

    **When to provide a pool**

    The break-even point is approximately 10,000 interior cells. Below this
    threshold the overhead of thread synchronisation, future creation, and
    queue operations exceeds the time saved by concurrent execution. At 50,000
    cells the concurrent path reduces assembly time by roughly 30-50%, which
    translates to approximately 7-10% reduction in total per-step wall time
    (the linear solve is unaffected and typically dominates at this scale).
    At 200,000+ cells the benefit is clearly measurable.

    A rough guide by grid size:

    - < 10,000 cells  → leave as `None`
    - 10,000-50,000   → marginal benefit, profile before committing
    - 50,000-200,000  → noticeable benefit, 3 workers recommended
    - > 200,000       → clearly beneficial, assembly cost approaches solve cost

    **Lifecycle**

    The pool is not created or shut down by `Config`. The caller is responsible
    for managing its lifetime. The recommended pattern is to create the pool
    once for the entire simulation run using `new_task_pool()` and pass it in
    at `Config` construction time:

    ```python
    with new_task_pool(concurrency=3) as pool:
        config = Config(..., task_pool=pool)
        for state in run(model, config):
            process(state)
    # Pool shuts down cleanly here
    ```

    Do not share a pool between concurrent simulation runs unless the pool has
    sufficient workers to service both simultaneously.

    **Thread safety**

    The assembly functions submitted to the pool are read-only on all shared
    grids. Each function writes only to its own private output arrays. There
    are no shared writes and no locks required during concurrent assembly.

    **Why `ThreadPoolExecutor` and not `ProcessPoolExecutor`**

    The assembly functions operate on large numpy arrays that are shared by
    reference between threads. `ProcessPoolExecutor` would require pickling and
    copying those arrays into child processes on every call - for a 100x100x30
    grid this is 30-50 MB of serialisation overhead per time step, which
    eliminates any parallelism gain entirely. Numba JIT-compiled functions also
    release the GIL during execution, so threads achieve true parallel CPU
    utilisation without GIL contention.

    Context manager that creates a `ThreadPoolExecutor` for concurrent

    Intended as the standard way to supply a `task_pool` to `Config`.

    when the `with` block exits - whether normally or due to an exception.

    :param concurrency: Maximum number of tasks that may run concurrently.

        which is almost always too large for simulation assembly. Pass an
        explicit value instead:

        - `3` for IMPES (pressure assembly has 3 independent stages,
          saturation assembly has 2 - 3 workers covers both without waste).
        - `2` if the machine has only 2 physical cores available to the
          process, or if memory bandwidth is the bottleneck rather than
          compute.
        - Higher values provide no additional benefit for the current
          assembly design, which submits at most 3 tasks per solver call.

    :yields: The configured `ThreadPoolExecutor`.

    Example: Standard IMPES run with concurrent assembly:

    from bores.config import Config, new_task_pool

    with new_task_pool(concurrency=3) as pool:
        config = Config(
            timer=timer,

        for state in run(model, config):
            process(state)
    # Pool shuts down here; all in-flight writes complete before exit
    ```

    Example: Conditional pool based on grid size:

    ```python
    interior_cells = (nx - 2) * (ny - 2) * (nz - 2)

    if interior_cells > 10_000:
        with new_task_pool(concurrency=3) as pool:

        config = Config(...)   # no pool, sequential assembly
        for state in run(model, config):
            process(state)
    ```

    Note: Do not pass the pool to more than one `Config` instance that
    will be used concurrently. Each simulation run submits up to 3 tasks
    per solver call; two concurrent runs would require 6 workers to avoid
    queuing, and the assembly functions are not designed for that usage.
