Explicit finite difference formulation for pressure diffusion in a N-Dimensional reservoir
(slightly compressible fluid):

The governing equation is the N-Dimensional linear-flow diffusivity equation:

    ∂p/∂t * (ρ·φ·c_t) * V = ∇ · (λ·∇p) * V + q * V

where:
    - ∂p/∂t * (ρ·φ·c_t) * V is the accumulation term (mass storage)
    - ∇ · (λ·∇p) * A is the diffusion term
    - q * V is the source/sink term (injection/production)

Assumptions:
    - Constant porosity (φ), total compressibility (c_t), and fluid density (ρ)
    - No convection or reaction terms
    - Cartesian grid (structured)
    - Fluid is slightly compressible; mobility is scalar

Simplified equation:

    ∂p/∂t * (φ·c_t) * V = ∇ · (λ·∇p) * V + q * V

Where:
    - V = cell volume = Δx * Δy * Δz
    - A = directional area across cell face
    - λ = mobility = k / μ
    - ∇p = pressure gradient
    - q = source/sink rate per unit volume

The diffusion term is expanded as:

    ∇ · (λ·∇p) = ∂/∂x (λ·∂p/∂x) + ∂/∂y (λ·∂p/∂y) + ∂/∂z (λ·∂p/∂z)

Explicit Discretization (Forward Euler in time, central difference in space):

    ∂p/∂t ≈ (pⁿ⁺¹_ijk - pⁿ_ijk) / Δt

    ∂/∂x (λ·∂p/∂x) ≈ (λ_{i+½,j,k}(pⁿ_{i+1,j,k} - pⁿ_{i,j,k}) - λ_{i-½,j,k}(pⁿ_{i,j,k} - pⁿ_{i-1,j,k})) / Δx²
    ∂/∂y (λ·∂p/∂y) ≈ (λ_{i,j+½,k}(pⁿ_{i,j+1,k} - pⁿ_{i,j,k}) - λ_{i,j-½,k}(pⁿ_{i,j,k} - pⁿ_{i,j-1,k})) / Δy²
    ∂/∂z (λ·∂p/∂z) ≈ (λ_{i,j,k+½}(pⁿ_{i,j,k+1} - pⁿ_{i,j,k}) - λ_{i,j,k-½}(pⁿ_{i,j,k} - pⁿ_{i,j,k-1})) / Δz²

Final explicit update formula:

    pⁿ⁺¹_ijk = pⁿ_ijk + (Δt / (φ·c_t·V)) * [
        A_x * (λ_{i+½,j,k}(pⁿ_{i+1,j,k} - pⁿ_{i,j,k}) - λ_{i-½,j,k}(pⁿ_{i,j,k} - pⁿ_{i-1,j,k})) / Δx +
        A_y * (λ_{i,j+½,k}(pⁿ_{i,j+1,k} - pⁿ_{i,j,k}) - λ_{i,j-½,k}(pⁿ_{i,j,k} - pⁿ_{i,j-1,k})) / Δy +
        A_z * (λ_{i,j,k+½}(pⁿ_{i,j,k+1} - pⁿ_{i,j,k}) - λ_{i,j,k-½}(pⁿ_{i,j,k} - pⁿ_{i,j,k-1})) / Δz +
        q_{i,j,k} * V
    ]

Where:
    - Δt is time step (s)
    - Δx, Δy, Δz are cell dimensions (ft)
    - A_x = Δy * Δz; A_y = Δx * Δz; A_z = Δx * Δy (ft²)
    - V = Δx * Δy * Δz (ft³)
    - λ_{i±½,...} = harmonic average of mobility between adjacent cells
    - q_{i,j,k} = injection/production rate per unit volume (ft³/s/ft³)

Stability Condition:
    Explicit scheme is conditionally stable. The N-Dimensional diffusion CFL criterion requires:

        D_x = λ·Δt / (φ·c_t·Δx²) < 1/6
        D_y = λ·Δt / (φ·c_t·Δy²) < 1/6
        D_z = λ·Δt / (φ·c_t·Δz²) < 1/6

Notes:
    - Harmonic averaging ensures continuity of flux across interfaces.
    - Volume-normalized source/sink terms only affect the cell where the well is located.
    - Can be easily adapted for anisotropic permeability by using λ_x, λ_y, λ_z separately.

    """
    Computes the total "pseudo" volumetric flux from a neighbour cell into the current cell
    based on the pressure differences, mobilities, and capillary pressures.

    The pseudo flux comes about due to the fact that we are are not using the pressure gradient, ∆P/∆x, or ∆P/∆y, or ∆P/∆z,
    but rather the pressure difference between the cells, ∆P.

    This will later be normalized by the cell geometric factor (A/∆x) to obtain the actual volumetric flow rate.

    This function calculates the pseudo volumetric flux for each phase (water, oil, gas)
    from the neighbour cell into the current cell using the harmonic mobility approach.
    The total volumetric flux is the sum of the individual phase fluxes, converted to ft³/day.
    The formula used is:

    q_total = (λ_w * Water Phase Potential Difference)
              + (λ_o * Oil Phase Potential Difference)
              + (λ_g * Gas Phase Potential Difference)

    Where:
        - λ_w, λ_o, λ_g are the harmonic mobilities of water, oil, and gas respectively.
        - Water Phase Potential Difference = [(P_neighbour - P_current) - (P_cow_neighbour - P_cow_current)]
                                            + (upwind_water_density * gravity * height_difference / 144.0)
        - Oil Phase Potential Difference = (P_neighbour - P_current) + (upwind_oil_density * gravity * height_difference / 144.0)
        - Gas Phase Potential Difference = [(P_neighbour + P_cgo_neighbour) - (P_current + P_cgo_current)]
                                            + (upwind_gas_density * gravity * height_difference / 144.0)
        - Upwinded densities are determined based on the pressure difference:
        - If the pressure difference is positive (P_neighbour - P_current > 0), we use the neighbour's density i.e.,
            Neighbour is upstream in the flow direction.
        - If the pressure difference is negative (P_neighbour - P_current < 0), we use the current cell's density.

    Computes the pressure evolution (specifically, oil phase pressure P_oil) in the reservoir grid
    for one time step using an explicit finite difference method. This function incorporates
    three-phase flow (water, oil, gas), phase-dependent mobility (derived from relative permeabilities
    and individual phase viscosities), and explicit capillary pressure gradients (both oil-water
    and gas-oil) as contributions to the pressure change. Wettability (water-wet or oil-wet)
    is accounted for in the capillary pressure calculations.

    The governing equation for pressure evolution (derived from total fluid conservation) is:
