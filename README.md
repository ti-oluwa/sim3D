BORES is a Python framework for 3D black-oil reservoir simulation of three-phase (oil, water, gas) flow in porous media. It provides a clean, modular API for building reservoir models, defining wells and fractures, running simulations, and analyzing results.

> **Disclaimer**: BORES is designed for **educational, research, and prototyping purposes**. It is not production-grade software and should not be used for critical business decisions or regulatory compliance. Results should be validated against established commercial simulators before any real-world application.

**Full documentation**: [https://ti-oluwa.github.io/bores](https://ti-oluwa.github.io/bores)

> NOTE: The latest release does not match the current docs. The release for the current docs is still in development and is almost ready.

## Installation

```bash
pip install bores-framework
```

## Contributing

BORES was developed by a graduate petroleum engineer with just theoretical knowledge and research experience. The project does not have the benefit of decades of field experience backing its implementations, so contributions from practitioners and researchers are welcome.

**Reporting issues**: If you find bugs, inaccuracies in the physics, or unexpected behavior, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ti-oluwa/bores/issues) on GitHub with a clear description and, if possible, a minimal example that reproduces the problem.

**Improvements**: Pull requests for bug fixes, documentation improvements, and enhancements that fall within the scope of a black-oil reservoir simulation framework are welcome. Please keep changes focused and well-tested.

**Out of scope**: Changes that go beyond the black-oil formulation (compositional simulation, thermal recovery, geomechanical coupling) are outside the current scope of the project.
